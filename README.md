# D-Rule Service (geddit?)
> A scratch project for exploring SpringBoot and Drools

I created this project so that I could explore integration between Spring Boot and Drools. Specifically configuration
and testing. But also how a generic service could be exposed via a REST interface.

## Installing / Getting started

```shell
mvn clean install
java -jar target rule-service-${version}.jar
```
